This list contains books I occasionally revisit to refresh my understanding of specific topics. I highly recommend them, they are excellent.

### Systems Performance

For anything related to system or _computer performance_ - such as observability and profiling - read anything by [Brendan Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com). Here are his books:
* [Systems Performance (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)](https://a.co/d/04XKzQLJ)
* [BPF Performance Tools (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)](https://a.co/d/06prHrgc)

### Cryptography

I really enjoyed [Real-World Cryptography (Manning)](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography) by David Wong when I first read it - it is a great introduction to _cryptography_ (…and a refresher for me, as I learned cryptography in Slovak at university). If your goal is to deepen your knowledge of TLS, here are some additional sources that complement the book mentioned earlier:
* [The Illustrated TLS 1.2 Connection](https://tls12.xargs.org)
* [The Illustrated TLS 1.3 Connection](https://tls13.xargs.org)
* [TLS Cryptography In-Depth (Packt)](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/tls-cryptography-in-depth-9781804611951)

non-technical:
* [Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers](https://a.co/d/0gngo4SO)

### Go

For the [Go](https://go.dev/) language, start with the official documentation. However I find the following resources helpful for exploring specific Go-related topics, for example:
* [Concurrency](https://antonz.org/go-concurrency) - I can't recommend this interactive book enough, it teaches Go concurrency from the ground up through practical exercises.
* At some point, explore the source code of high-profile open source projects, such as Kubernetes, to see how experienced developers implement things.

### Computer networking

For _computer networking_, my favorite book is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://a.co/d/0b1UrvAx) by James Kurose and Keith Ross. The following resources complement and expand on the topics covered in the book:
* [TCP/IP Illustrated: The Protocols (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)](https://a.co/d/06lIrP5o)
* [DNS and BIND, 5th Edition (O'Reilly)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/dns-and-bind/0596100574)
* [HTTP/2 in Action (Manning)](https://www.manning.com/books/http2-in-action) by Barry Pollard
